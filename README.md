# Craftable-Baseball-Bat
Project Zomboid mod that adds a recipe for the Baseball Bat.

This is a replacement for gzeta's Crafted Baseball Bat. 
His version was incompatible with mods that used the vanilla Baseball Bat for crafting recipes (The Workshop, Scrap Weapons etc.)

# To build a Baseball Bat you'll need:
```ts
1 Log

1 Saw or any type of Axe (Not dull)

1 HuntingKnife/IcePick/Machete/MeatCleaver (Not dull)

Level 3 Carpentry and Level 1 Carving
```

Compatible with any mod. Build 42.0+
