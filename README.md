# Craftable-Baseball-Bat
Project Zomboid mod that adds a recipe for the Baseball Bat.

This is a replacement for gzeta's Crafted Baseball Bat. 
His version was incompatible with mods that used the vanilla Baseball Bat for crafting recipes (The Workshop, Scrap Weapons etc.)

# To build a Baseball Bat you'll need:
1 Log

1 Saw/Axe/AxeStone/WoodAxe/HandAxe

1 HuntingKnife/IcePick/Machete/MeatCleaver

Level 5 Carpentry

# TODO: 
Add optional magazine for learning the crafting recipe.

Compatible with any mod. 46.65+
